# pizza_dataset
This analysis project focuses on one of the most popular global food icons "pizza" and in this analysis i am using Bigquery. My main goal is to uncover valuable insights from a collection of datasets that encompass various aspects. By carefully analyzing the pizza dataset, we can identify interesting patterns, evolving consumer trends, and perhaps even determine whether there is a relationship between certain factors, such as weather or seasons, and pizza preferences. Through this approach, we hope to provide beneficial insights for the culinary industry. <br/>
### About Dataset.
The pizza dataset comprises four tables:

1. The 'order' table with 4 columns: order_id, date, time.
2. The 'order_detail' table with 4 columns: order_id, order_details_id, pizza_id, quantity.
3. The 'pizzas' table with 4 columns: pizza_id, pizza_type_id, size, price.
4. The 'pizza_types' table with 4 columns: pizza_type_id, name, category, ingredient.

In total, there have been 48,620 transactions. In this analysis, I assume that the currency is in $.
<br/>
### Revenue and Quantity
The first step in this analysis is to calculate the Total Revenue and Total Quantity from all transactions.
<br/>
```
select concat("$ ",sum(od.quantity * p.price)) as Total_Revenue
FROM
  `pizza.order_details` od
LEFT JOIN
  `pizza.orders` o
ON
  od.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN
  `pizza.pizzas` p
ON
  od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id;
```

<br/>

```
select sum(od.quantity) as total_quantity
FROM
  `pizza.order_details` od
LEFT JOIN
  `pizza.orders` o
ON
  od.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN
  `pizza.pizzas` p
ON
  od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id;
```

### Monhtly Quantity and Revenue
By analyzing the monthly Quantity, I could identify trends in terms of when pizzas are ordered the most and whether there are any seasonal variations. Additionally, calculating monthly Revenue would provide insights into the revenue generated during different months, helping to identify peak periods and potential areas for improvement in terms of marketing.

```
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%B',o.date) AS `Month`,
  SUM(od.quantity) AS quantity,
  CONCAT("$ ",SUM(od.quantity * p.price)) AS Revenue
FROM
  `pizza.order_details` od
LEFT JOIN
  `pizza.orders` o
ON
  od.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN
  `pizza.pizzas` p
ON
  od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY
  `Month`;
```
