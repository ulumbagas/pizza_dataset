# pizza_dataset
This analysis project focuses on one of the most popular global food icons, namely pizza. My main goal is to uncover valuable insights from a collection of datasets that encompass various aspects. By carefully analyzing the pizza dataset, we can identify interesting patterns, evolving consumer trends, and perhaps even determine whether there is a relationship between certain factors, such as weather or seasons, and pizza preferences. Through this approach, we hope to provide beneficial insights for the culinary industry.
